<tr><td>Abstract</td><td>Good education of engineering students requires theoretical knoweldge and lots of calculation experience to better understand theory and applications.
  Laboratory courses are offered to better relate theory and practical understanding.
  Simulations even more improve the linking of theory and practice, as systemic thinking is supported.
  Students learn to understand the interaction of simple models and more advanced systems.<br>
  In the keynote speech two virtual education scenarios in engineering will be presented:<br>
  First, a workflow of creating and evaluating calculation and simulation examples is proposed.
  The workflow is based on Modelica and the online tool Letto.<br>
  Second, virtual lab experiments of electric machines and drives are shown.
  In the virtual lab Modelica variables are controlled and viszualized by Labview.
  The presented approaches are possible steps in the direction of virtual education to improve and strengthen the students' expertise and knowledge
  and with the particular intention to motivate students.</td></tr>
