<h2>Proceedings</h2>
<p>
The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers 
to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica and to the Functional Mockup Interface.
</p>

<p>
Since the start of the collaborative design work for Modelica in 1996, 
Modelica has matured from an idea among a small number of dedicated enthusiasts 
to a widely accepted standard language for the modeling and simulation of cyber-physical systems. 
In addition, the standardization of the language by the non-profit organization Modelica Association 
enables Modelica models to be portable between a growing number of tools. 
Modelica is now used in many industries including automotive, energy and process, aerospace, and industrial equipment. 
Modelica is the language of choice for model-based systems engineering.
</p>


<p>Starting with this conference, you will notice some changes:</p>
<p>First, we are going to organize the International Modelica Conference every two years in spring. 
In the years between International Modelica Conferences, Modelica Conferences are organized on other continents with country specific focus.  
Although in 2018 there have been two very successful conferences in Japan and in the United States, 
we received 101 submissions from authors all over the world which have been thoroughly reviewed.</p>
<p>Second, additional to the tutorials and vendor presentations on the first day of the conference, 
we are going to have <a href="userpres.html"><strong>Industrial User Presentations</strong></a> related to the <strong>Modelica Association Projects</strong>. 
These presentations are not included in the proceedings, but they should provide a nucleus for discussions and broadening the users groups.</p>

<p>The program is available in an event app for smartphones and tablets running Android and iOS, 
as well as accessible online with any web browser. 
After the conference, the proceedings will be officially published by Link&ouml;ping University Electronic Press.</p>

<p>Conference highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Keynote speeches</li>
<li>76 oral presentations in 4 parallel tracks</li>
<li>13 posters</li>
<li>7 tutorials</li>
<li>14 vendor sessions presenting the latest Modelica and FMI tools</li>
<li>A commercial exhibition area featuring 17 exhibitors</li>
<li>Electronic proceedings including all papers and some associated Modelica libraries and models</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we want to acknowledge the support we received from the conference board and program committee.
The support from the conference sponsors &amp; exhibitors is gratefully acknowledged. 
Last, but not least, thanks to all authors, keynote speakers, and presenters for their contributions to this conference.</p>

<p>We wish all participants an enjoyable and inspiring conference.</p>
